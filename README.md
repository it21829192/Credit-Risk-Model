Credit Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Models
Credit Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict credit risk using real-world data. The solution leverages Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting models to assess the likelihood of credit default, providing a robust and interpretable approach for financial risk analysis.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.

Model Training: Utilizes Random Forest as the primary classifier, with additional comparisons using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance through classification reports, confusion matrices, and feature importance analysis.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters using GridSearchCV.

Cross-Validation: Ensures model robustness and generalizability.

Dataset
The dataset includes customer information relevant to credit risk assessment, such as demographic details, financial history, and transaction records. (Replace this with a link or description of your actual dataset.)
